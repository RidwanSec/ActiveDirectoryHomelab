Overview

This project is a hands-on homelab setup where I built and managed an Active Directory (AD) environment to simulate a real-world enterprise network. The goal was to strengthen my skills in identity and access management, domain administration, and automation with PowerShell.


Key Features

Configured a Windows Server as a Domain Controller.

Created and managed Active Directory users and groups.

Automated user creation and management tasks using PowerShell scripts.

Connected a client workstation to the domain to test authentication and group policy functionality.

Practiced fundamental administration tasks such as login, permissions, and security configurations.


Tools & Technologies

Windows Server (Active Directory Domain Services)

PowerShell

VirtualBox / VMware (for virtualization)

Windows 10 (client machine)


Key Takeaways

Setting up and administering Active Directory in a controlled environment.

Automating repetitive admin tasks with PowerShell.

Understanding how domain-joined machines interact with Active Directory.

Practical skills applicable to system administration, and cybersecurity roles.


Lab Walk-Through

To accomodate my Domain Controller (DC) on the Virtual Machine, Two network adapters are required. Firstly, a NAT adapter utilizing my home router's IP address to facilitate external connectivity , and secondly, an Internal Network Adapter (VMnet0) to  enable communication with other Virtual Machines. Diplayed in the image below.

After installing Windows Server 2019 ISO on the Virtual Machine, I did network configuration by renaming the network adapters (External and Internal), that way I can differentiate NAT adapter utilizing my home router's IP address, which is the external network adapter from the internal one which is the Virtual Machine network.

Next, I configured the Internal network Adapter, by assigning the IP address in the first image (172.16.0.1). I left the default gateway blank since the Domain Controller serves as the gateway. For DNS server configuration, I allocated the IP address in the first image, anticipating Active directory installation, which automatically installs DNS.

After configuring the network adapters, I move on to renaming the PC from its current default name to "DC" (Domain Controller). This action requires the PC to restart.

After the restart, I then proceed to intalling the active directory domain services (AD DS), to create the domain

After Active Directory Domain Services installation, I have to set up the Post-Deployment Configuration, by promoting the server to the domain controller which is creating the domain, by adding new forest.

After the server is being promoted to the domain, it enforced a restart, after the restart, you will notice the domain has been successfully created as Ridwan has been added to the admin account, as it now display RIDWAN\Administrator.

Now instead of using the built admin account, I created a dedicated admin account, by clicking on start, the clicked on Active Directory Users and Computers.
